film_processor
==============

film_processor is a utility to bulk process media files to get them ready for editing.
Right now that means taking XAVC movies files and turning them into ProRes or DNxHR files
that DaVinci Resolve on Linux can understand. I have some other plans with externally
recorded audio files, but that's not done yet.
